The atmosphere was quite friendly, Mr. Jaffe listened with interest to Lindsey Doubleday's idea of how AI can help with the desert land problem. She gesticulated heavily, furiously proving that her project only looked complicated, but in reality a couple of dozen drones could cope with the task of controlling the area.\n\nI was enjoying this lecture when four more people came up to the table.\n\n-Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here.

But even so, you can come up with something to make the country better. Am I right, Mr. Runner?\n\n- Well.. - I thought - I don't really understand the problems of protecting drones, to be honest, but it seems to me that AeroMach has made a new model of robots that can move at a speed of 2.5 times faster than the speed of sound. And besides this, they must support fifth-generation AI right on board. Shouldn't this be enough?\n\n- Exactly!! Now you see! - she again turned to Mr. Yaffe - You can do anything, the main thing is to adapt to the situation correctly!\n\nJaffe was clearly confused by the ardor of the girl who bored him with her green eyes.\n\nIn the meantime, we did not notice how four more people came up to the table, and one of them quietly clapped his hands.\n\n- My respects, Miss Doubleday.

It knew exactly where I was.\n\nSo, now it is coming right behind me, I just need to understand the moment when it will attack. And then I'll take it down with a couple of accurate shots.\n\nAnother half minute passed. It slowly crawled out somewhere at the level of the third floor. We knew for sure that we were seeing each other.\n\nJerk. I jumped back a little and unleashed a volley of laser rifles with one hand. The distance was too great, only a couple of shells hit its hull. But it was enough to throw off its disguise.\n\nThe scanner is now useless. Dropping it to the ground, I took the rifle in both hands and took aim. If I hit well, then a couple of shots will be enough ...\n\nSuddenly, the spider jumped just like last time, but from a much greater height. I tried to aim at its belly and squeezed the trigger. A shower of sparks flew from my opponent's belly, but it flew at me anyway. I can't make it...\n\nA heavy iron carcass fell right on top of me, knocking me down. The second pair of front paws pressed my hands hard to the ground, and with the first pair of front legs, the spider swung high above its head and released the blades.\n\nThis is the end...\n\n[[Cruel reality...]] ",

But that won't help him.\n\nI realized where he was, and throwing the scanner on the ground, took up the rifle. A long burst of pulses went up the wall where the spider had been. Several shells hit him directly, temporarily disabling his trump card.\n\n-DIIEEE!!\n\nI aimed a little better and squeezed the trigger. It tried to jump from the third floor straight at me, but I kept shooting. Thoughtlessly, until the gun overheated.\n\nInstead of a robot, only some melted remains fell to the ground. I fired a couple more shots into its snout, more out of anger than necessity, and then my hands suddenly trembled and weakened.\n\nEverything was over.\n\n[[Go to the city center]]",

But the warrior who always met us was not here.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nJurgen and Ana had cuts on their faces, and Lindsey bit her lip as she held on to her injured leg. Obviously, she couldn't walk fast, but somehow managed to.\n\nI approached the others and asked:\n\n- The others are still there, right?\n\n- Yes. - answered Jurgen. - And they've been there too long.\n\nI looked at Lindsey, and she looked at me:\n\n- That damn robot didn't show up until the very end. I walked half the arena with the pin pulled out from a grenade! Is it possible to make such a dishonest opponent?\n\n- I'm not sure...\n\nI did not manage to agree. Suddenly, it was as if a veil had been lifted from the surroundings, and we saw the main street.\n\nThere were four spiders in different places, and next to them ..\n\n- ANDREW! Lindsey screamed.\n\nLindsey's brother was lying on the ground with a bruised head and was barely crawling on the ground. Besides, Saddam was crawling right behind him. His legs turned into some kind of bloody mess.\n\n[[-What a horror is going on here...]]",

The spider let out something like a squeal, and began to wave its paws from side to side.\n\n- It's time to finish.\n\nThrowing the last grenade, I made the robot stop twitching, and only after that I came out to my full height and with pleasure squeezed the trigger on the rifle, burning hole after hole in the hull.\n\nA few seconds - and the main processor is damaged.

But now your journey is coming to an end. Smile at me, for you will accept death at my hands..\n\nWith these words, she aimed her muzzle at Ajitt, and fired a long burst at his body. He did not even have time to scream, as two bullets went through his skull, scattering fragments of the skull on the asphalt.\n\nAnna screamed in horror somewhere behind, and I could not tear myself away from the spectacle.\n\nThe warrior slowly walked towards Riley, who was struggling to crawl away from the girl backwards.\n\n- No, no.. It's not fair! NPCs don't behave like that, I demand revenge!\n\nA cold voice answered him only one thing:\n\n- Nothing to fix. You fell like a warrior, so accept death like a warrior.\n\nWith that, Riley screamed, but a short burst to the chest quickly ended his wailing.\n\n- We're not going to die, are we? Am I dreaming this? muttered Avigdor.\n\nThe same story repeated itself with Saddam. He tried to say something, about the fact that he was a CAR employee, and he should not be killed, but the girl was adamant. Another fell.\n\nOnly Andrew remained.\n\n- Andrew, no!
